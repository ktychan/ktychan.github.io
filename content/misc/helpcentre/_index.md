I am the coordinator for York University [Math & Stats Help Centre and Study Hub](https://www.yorku.ca/science/mathstats/help-for-undergrads/) (formerly Math & Stats Lab) for the 2022-2023 academic year.

Math & Stats **Help Centre and Study Hub** (formerly Math & Stats Lab) is a free, walk-in, Q&A style learning service and study space offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. This service is available to all students enrolled in a first or second-year mathematics or statistics course.
