I am the coordinator for [Math/Stats Lab](https://www.yorku.ca/science/mathstats/help-for-undergrads/) for Fall 2022 and Winter 2023 semesters. 

The Math & Stats Lab is a FREE (!), walk-in, one-on-one **Q & A style tutoring service** and **study space** offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics for all first and second-year students enrolled in a mathematics or statistics course.
