  <h2>Research</h2>

  <div style="margin: 1em">
    Diagonal harmonics in superspace is a natural extension of the classical
    coinvariant theory of symmetric groups. I am motivated by a conjecture by
    Zabrocki that links such a module to the Delta conjecture. I found a new
    description of its alternating component and subsequently conjectured an
    \(\mathcal{S}_{n}\)-invariant basis that generalized the classical higher
    Specht basis.
