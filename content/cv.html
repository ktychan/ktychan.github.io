    <h4>Instructor, York University</h4>

    <ul>
      <li> Math 1013 &mdash; Applied Calculus II, Fall 2023 
        <p>
        Math 1013 is a large multi-section, coordinated, first-year undergraduate course with roughly 1200 students spread across 10 sections. Most of the students were science and engineering majors. With Prof. Amenda Chow, I co-coordinated the course and developed the course material. I developed weekly instructional worksheets for all instructors. Each instructional worksheet is about 4 to 5 pages long and contains detailed learning objectives, outlines for core concepts and suggestions for in-class activities, experiments, discussions and problems. Instructional worksheets are shared to all students for transparency. Students responded in surveys that they found the worksheet generally helpful.

        My section had about 150 students.

        (excluding the pandemic months from Summer 2021 to Winter 2022)
        <p>
        The Math &amp; Stats Help Centre and Study Hub is a free walk-in service for all first- and second-year courses offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. During my time as the coordinator, I focused on improving student engagement and experience. I successfully renamed the Help Centre from Math Lab to help student
