    <h4>Instructor, York University</h4>

    <ul>
      <li> Math 1014 &mdash; Applied Calculus I, Winter 2024
        <p>
        I am the coordinator of all eleven sections with about 1100 students in total. I have ten instructors on my team, including two faculty members, one postdoc, five sessional instructors and one graduate student instructor. One instructor has never taught in North America. I also manage 24 teaching assistants. To ensure consistency across sections, I developed detailed learning outcomes and content summaries and chose practice problems from the textbook for each topic for all instructors. 
        </p>

        <p>
        My section has 150 students. 
        </p>
      </li>

      <li> Math 1200 &mdash; Problems, Conjectures and Proofs, Winter 2024
        <p>
        I take a reading- and writing-first approach in this course. In addition to teaching mathematical logic and problem-solving, I guide students to read with purpose and explore by asking questions. I teach proof-writing as a natural product of mathematical storytelling and a recording of a progression of thoughts.
        </p>

        <p>
        My section has 20 students. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li> Math 1013 &mdash; Applied Calculus II, Fall 2023 
        <p>
        Math 1013 is a large multi-section, coordinated, first-year undergraduate course with roughly 1200 students spread across 10 sections. Most of the students were science and engineering majors.  </p>

        <p>
        My section had about 150 students. 
        </p>


        <p>
        With Prof. Amenda Chow, I co-coordinated the course and developed weekly instructional worksheets for all instructors. Each instructional worksheet contains detailed learning objectives, outlines for core concepts and suggestions for in-class activities, experiments, discussions and problems. Instructional worksheets are shared to all students for transparency. Students responded in surveys that they found the worksheets generally helpful.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li> Math 1014 &mdash; Applied Calculus II, Winter 2022
        <p>
        Math 1014 is a large multi-section, coordinated, first-year undergraduate course with roughly 1000 students spread across 6 sections. Most of the students were science and engineering majors. 
        </p>

        <p>
        My section had about 170 students.

        (Closed during the pandemic)
        <p>
        The Math &amp; Stats Help Centre and Study Hub is a free walk-in service for all first- and second-year courses offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. I managed 600 to 800 TA hours per semester. I focused on improving student engagement and experience. I actively and frequently sought feedback from students and graduate teaching assistants.

    <h4>Teaching Assistant, York University</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Math 1200 &mdash; Problems, Conjectures and Proofs, 2018 to 2023 
        <p>
        I enjoyed every minute of TAing for this course. I taught tutorials for Math 1200 every semester in various styles including facilitating problem-solving sessions, leading discussions, giving supplementary lectures, and facilitating student presentations. Typical attendance is about 10 to 15 students.
        </p>

        <p>
        I developed a grading strategy called two-pass evaluation. This project is now a book chapter (to be published) on transparency in teaching.
