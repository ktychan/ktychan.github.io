Let $q$ be a formal symbol.  The Hecke algebra $H_{n}(q)$ of the
symmetric group is generated by $T_{1}, \dots, T_{n-1}$ subject to
relations
\[
\begin{aligned}
(T_{i} - q)(T_{i} + 1) &= 0, && i=1,\dots,n-1 \\
T_{i}T_{j} &= T_{j} T_{i}, && |i-j| \gt 1 \\
T_{i}T_{i+1}T_{i} &= T_{i+1}T_{i}T_{i+1}, && i=1,\dots,n-2.
\end{aligned}
\]
Another set of generators are obtained by setting $\square_{i} = T_{i}+1$.

* Divided Difference Operators

Define /divided difference/ operators $\partial_{i} =
\frac{1-s_{i}}{x_{i}-x_{i+1}}$.  Note
\[
s_{i} \partial_{i} = \partial_{i}, \quad \partial_{i} s_{i} = - \partial_{i}
 \quad\textrm{and}\quad \partial_{i}^{2} = 0.
\]

Define /Demazure operators/
\[
\pi_{i} = \partial_{i}x_{i} \quad\textrm{and}\quad \hat{\pi}_{i} =
\pi_{i} - 1 = x_{i+1}\partial_{i}.
\]
Note $\pi_{i}^{2} = \pi_{i}$ and $\hat{\pi}_{i}^{2} = - \hat{\pi}_{i}$.

Since all of $\partial_{i}, \pi_{i}, \hat{\pi}_{i}$ satisfy
braid relations, there are two ways to realize the $0$-Hecke
algebra as operators on $\mathbb{Q}[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]$:
\[
\square_{i} \mapsto \pi_{i} \quad\textrm{or}\quad \square_{i} \mapsto
s_{i} - \hat{\pi}_{i}.
\]
