#+title: Multivariate Diagonal Harmonics

Fix a pair $k,n \ge 1$.  We consider the space $\mathcal{D}_{n}$ of
/diagonal harmonics/ generated by $V_{n}$ and closed under partial
differentiation and polarization operators.  Let $\mathcal{A}_{n} =
\langle \mathcal{D}_{n}, s_{1^{n}} \rangle$ denote the /alternating/ component
of $\mathcal{D}_{n}$.

* The Skewing Trick
{{< theorem >}}
For each $k \ge 1$, we have
\[
e_{k}^{\perp} \mathcal{A}_{n} = \langle \mathcal{D}_{n}, s_{(k \mid n-k-1)} \rangle.
\]
{{< /theorem >}}

We start with an example at $k=2$.  The Frobenius series of $\mathcal{D}_{3}$ is
\[
\mathcal{D}_{3} = 1 \otimes s_{3} + (s_{11} + s_{2}) \otimes s_{21} + (s_{3} +
s_{11}) \otimes s_{111}.
\]
