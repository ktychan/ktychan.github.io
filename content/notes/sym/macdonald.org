#+title: Macdonald Polynomial

* Introduction
Let $\Lambda$ to be the usual ring of symmetric functions over
$\mathbb{Q}$.  We work in the ring $\Lambda \otimes \mathbb{Q}(q,t)$ of
symmetric function over the field of rational functions
$\mathbb{Q}(q,t)$.  Macdonald polynomials are a family of orthogonal
polynomials.

** Basic Identities
The modified Macdonald polynomial has a simply $q,t$-symmetric: For
any partition $\mu$
\[
\tilde{H}_{\mu'}(q,t;\bm{z}) = \tilde{H}_{\mu}(t,q;\bm{z}).
\]
This is derived from the identity
\[
q^{n(\mu)}t^{n(\mu)} \tilde{H}_{\mu}(q^{-1};t^{-1};\bm{z}) = \tilde{H}_{\mu}(q,t;\bm{z}).
\]

* Nabla and Delta Operators
We encode a partition $\mu$ as a polynomial $B_{\mu} = \sum_{(a,b) \in
\mu} q^{a}t^{b}$.  Define a family of eigenoperators $\Delta_{f}:
\Lambda \otimes \mathbb{Q}(q,t) \to \Lambda \otimes \mathbb{Q}(q,t)$ indexed by
symmetric function $f \in \Lambda$ by \[ \Delta_{f} \tilde{H}_{\mu} =
f[B_{\mu}] \tilde{H}_{\mu}.  \]

Nabla is the special case $\nabla = \Delta_{e_{n}}$.
