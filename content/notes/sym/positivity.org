#+title: Positivity Relations

* $s$-positive
By Littlewood-Richardson rule, all skew Schur functions are Schur
positive.  It follows that $e_{\lambda}$ and $h_{\lambda}$ are both
Schur positive since they are skew shapes.

* $e$-positive
Vertical strip LLT polynomials $\mathbb{L}_{\bm{\nu}}(X;q+1)$ are
Schur.  This was proved by D'Addario and its proof uses the Dyck path
operators.
